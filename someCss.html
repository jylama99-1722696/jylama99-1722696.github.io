        <p style="font-family:Fantasy;"> Somebody put some brakes on me
            I really need rest on me
            Pops callin' up every couple days
            I'm smilin' so he could think I'm straight
            Why can't I tell the truth?
            Playin' J. Cole back then, with a clear end goal
            Like it all made sense, I needed myself
            And nobody else, okay, let's go, uh
            From how it looks, man, it's hard to complain
            Man, I just been prayin' that when I get older
            That I got some smile in me that can remain
            My money is long but I got some new issues
            That feel like as long as they government names
            Man, all I could wish is the mask that I wear
            And the face that's below it is lookin' the same, like
            (Oh, oh, oh) You been in this fight
            I can see it in your eyes, like
            (Oh, oh, oh) I made up my mind
            I don't wanna waste no time, yeah </p>

        <p style="font-family:Monospace;"> Shut the fuck up, don't wake another neighbor (yeah, shut the fuck up)
            I don't know you and I don't want to later (later)
            Praying to God I never run out of His favor
            But we don't make the textbooks on our best behavior, do we?
            I'm the anti-hero in my own damn movie (movie)
            All my exes write songs that I'm based on, loosely
            Take after my ma, I can be choosy
            I can be choosy, oh
            And when the sky looks like a painting
            That's when you look down</p>
